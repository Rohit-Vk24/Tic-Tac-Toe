# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic Tac Toe game is a web-based application that brings the classic game to life on the screen. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game provides a user-friendly interface where players can enjoy challenging against a computer opponent.

I have built this game as part of my JavaScript mini projects which helps increase my understanding on JavaScript concepts. This game is different as it is single player game contrast to original game where two users play the game. I also made it responsive as i follow "mobile first approach" so as to enjoy this game on all devices.

The JavaScript code in the Tic Tac Toe game handles the game's logic and user interaction. It sets up event listeners for cell clicks and restart button clicks. When a cell is clicked, it checks if it's empty and updates the cell with the current player's symbol. It then checks for a winner or a tie condition. In the single-player mode, the code also implements the computer's move by randomly selecting an empty cell. The code updates the display to show the current player's turn and handles the outcome of the game, including displaying the winner. It provides an interactive and engaging game experience using JavaScript.
